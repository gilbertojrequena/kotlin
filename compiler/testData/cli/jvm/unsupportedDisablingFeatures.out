warning: ATTENTION!
This build uses unsafe internal compiler arguments:

-XXLanguage:-NewInference
-XXLanguage:-SamConversionPerArgument

This mode is not recommended for production use,
as no stability/compatibility guarantees are given on
compiler or generated code. Use it at your own risk!

error: the following features are enabled by default and couldn't be disabled explicitly anymore, because the corresponding language version is no longer supported:
NewInference (enabled since 1.4), SamConversionPerArgument (enabled since 1.4)
COMPILATION_ERROR
