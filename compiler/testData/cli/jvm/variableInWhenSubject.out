warning: ATTENTION!
This build uses unsafe internal compiler arguments:

-XXLanguage:+VariableDeclarationInWhenSubject

This mode is not recommended for production use,
as no stability/compatibility guarantees are given on
compiler or generated code. Use it at your own risk!

warning: the following features are already enabled by default, explicit enabling of them is redundant
VariableDeclarationInWhenSubject (enabled since 1.3)

warning: language version 1.4 is deprecated and its support will be removed in a future version of Kotlin
OK
